       "'A factor model is a financial modeling approach that assumes the observed variables are driven by a few underlying factors. The general form of a factor model is rt = φ0 + h(ft) + wt, where rt denotes the observed variable (e.g., stock prices), φ0 represents a constant vector, ft represents the few underlying factors responsible for most of the randomness in the market, and wt is a residual vector representing perturbations with only marginal effects. The function h(ft) represents how these underlying factors affect the higher-dimensional market. Factor models can be further categorized into explicit factor models, where the underlying factors are explicitly observable market variables, and hidden factor models, which employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the structure of the covariance matrix and locate a low-dimensional subspace that captures most of the variation in the observed variables.'"
